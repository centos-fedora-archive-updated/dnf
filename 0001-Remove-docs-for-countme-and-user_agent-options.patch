-    :ref:`boolean <boolean-label>`
-
-    Determines whether a special flag should be added to a single, randomly
-    chosen metalink/mirrorlist query each week.
-    This allows the repository owner to estimate the number of systems
-    consuming it, by counting such queries over a week's time, which is much
-    more accurate than just counting unique IP addresses (which is subject to
-    both overcounting and undercounting due to short DHCP leases and NAT,
-    respectively).
-
-    The flag is a simple "countme=N" parameter appended to the metalink and
-    mirrorlist URL, where N is an integer representing the "longevity" bucket
-    this system belongs to.
-    The following 4 buckets are defined, based on how many full weeks have
-    passed since the beginning of the week when this system was installed: 1 =
-    first week, 2 = first month (2-4 weeks), 3 = six months (5-24 weeks) and 4
-    = more than six months (> 24 weeks).
-    This information is meant to help distinguish short-lived installs from
-    long-term ones, and to gather other statistics about system lifecycle.

-    Default is False.
