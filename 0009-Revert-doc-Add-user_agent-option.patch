-``user_agent``
-    :ref:`string <string-label>`
-
-    The User-Agent string to include in HTTP requests sent by DNF.
-    Defaults to ::
-
-        libdnf/VERSION (NAME VERSION_ID; VARIANT_ID; OS.BASEARCH)
-
-    where VERSION is the libdnf version, NAME, VERSION_ID and VARIANT_ID are OS
-    identifiers read from the :manpage:`os-release(5)` file and OS and BASEARCH
-    are the canonical OS name and base architecture, respectively.
-    Example: ::
-
-        libdnf/0.35.2 (Fedora 31; server; Linux.x86_64)
-
-    To prevent the leakage of identifiable information, the whole OS part
-    (enclosed in parenthesis) is omitted if this is a non-Fedora or non-Linux
-    system, or is running an unknown Fedora variant.
-
-``countme``
-    :ref:`boolean <boolean-label>`
-
-    Determines whether a "countme" flag should be added to a single, randomly
-    chosen metalink query each week.
-    This allows the repository owner to estimate the number of systems
-    consuming it, by counting such queries over a week's time, which is much
-    more accurate than just counting unique IP addresses (which is subject to
-    both overcounting and undercounting due to short DHCP leases and NAT,
-    respectively).
-    The flag is a simple static parameter appended to the metalink URL and is
-    the same on every system (that means, no personal or machine-specific
-    information is included).
-    Default is False.
